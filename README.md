# Rock Paper Scissors in Python!
### An electronic take on a classic game!
#### Pick your weapon and play against the computer - you'll only get a virtual sting if you lose!

Prerequisites: All you need is [Python](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0) to play. 

Clone the project, navigate to the directory - <code>cd directoryname</code> - and run the game.py file in a Python Terminal window for mac / Linux.

The rules are the same as the classic game:

<ol>
<li>Paper covers Rock</li>
<li>Scissors cuts Paper</li>
<li>Rock smashes Scissors</li>
</ol>

<b><i>Choose your weapon wisely!</i></b>

The computer chooses first; just follow the prompts.

Built with Python 3.

Enjoy!
